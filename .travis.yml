#   # Here we just install Miniconda, which you shouldn't have to change.

#   - wget http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh
#   - chmod +x miniconda.sh
#   - ./miniconda.sh -b
#   - export PATH=/home/travis/miniconda3/bin:$PATH
#   - conda update --yes conda


install:

  # We just set up a conda environment with the right Python version. This
  # should not need changing.

  # - conda create --yes -n test python=$TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION
  # - source activate test

  # Below, include the dependencies you want to install with conda, optionally
  # specifying versions used in the matrix above. If you split this into
  # multiple conda install commands, you should always include numpy=$NUMPY as
  # the first package to install (for every conda install command) otherwise
  # numpy may be automatically upgraded.

  - conda install --yes pip swig numpy pandas scikit-learn

  # You can also install some dependencies with pip if not available in conda

  # - pip install ...
  # if some package depends on numpy, Numpy should be installed with conda.
  - pip install codecov
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
